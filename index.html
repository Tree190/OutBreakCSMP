People just wiped it under the rug when it first started… but then, it got worse. People showed signs of mutation. Sometimes you could barely tell when someone became an Infecti, other times you couldn’t even recognize the person mutated. People studied the Infecti and noticed that animals of any kind weren’t infected, more so hypnotized. No one could find the source before their demise. Now, there are only 4 people left. Can they find the source and kill it, or will they crack and give in to a new life service to this controller of Infecti?</p>
