        <h1 class="Line">♧</h1>

        <p class="Line">♧ There are 5 gods and goddesses in total. <span class="D">Death</span>, <span class="DE">Destruction</span>, <span class="L">Life</span>, <span class="N">Nature</span>, and <span class="S">Space</span>. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ They Once lived together in peace, paying no mind to anyone else’s role but only themselves. This peace was broken one fatal day when gratefulness was wearing thin, and jealousy grew. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life had challenged Death, but his brother refused with a polite but firm statement of <span class="D">“You are my brother, and I will do no such thing as to harm you. I care for you too much”</span> Life was enraged. <span class="L">“Fight me you coward! Fight me!”</span> Life kept screaming as his brother walked away. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life Cleary in a pure state of rage, had decided to try and ruin his brother’s work. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ At first, he tried to overload him with souls he had forced nature to help him with. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="N">“But that would be bad for the population and animals, can’t you think of any other way?”</span> He didn’t care. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ A plague didn’t seem to faze his brother, not one bit. This had upset him even more. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Nature had stored the Plague to protect anyone from getting hurt. She had felt horrible for what she helped Life do and swore to herself <span class="N">“I shall never speak or even think of him ever again!”</span> ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Then life had gone to Space for his insight on this situation, space had insight on what was Justice or not, what was right and what was wrong. He was the insight of the Universe. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Space had foreseen his arrival and knew exactly what would happen and every possible outcome, he wasn’t going down without a fight. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="S">“I know why you have come, and I shall have no part in this mess!”</span> space had started firmly and loudly. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life was engulfed in pure hatred; everyone he had gone to wasn’t helping him. He thought they had turned their backs on him and stabbed his. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧So, he pulled out the Bioweapon. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ A weapon created by Miss Universe, only to be used in high stress situations. Life thought this was a perfect use. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ He had studied and studied it for eon’s, estimating and conducting answers to what if it was used on this or that, he knew what would happen if he used it on Space, death would be given. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life didn’t want this, he wanted to make him suffer but not to a lethal extent. He also knew how to control it, make it so it wasn’t lethal. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life had used it on space striking him straight in the heart and keeping it there. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Space had taken his final glance at the roof above him before everything went black. He could still see for some reason but not with his eyes. He was seeing the world in someone else’s eyes; A new vessel was being sent to earth. ♧</p>

        <h1 class="Line">♧</h1>

        <p class="Line">♧ Stress was high and safety was wearing thin, the disappearance of space was unusual. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ He would never neglect his duties let alone his family like that, he wasn’t like that. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Destruction and Nature decided to do a little investigative work around the palace. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ They decided to split up compass wise. <span class="DE">“I’ll take the north and east and you take south and west, ok?”</span> <span class="N">“Ok!”</span> then they spilt, bad move. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ After a couple of hours, nature was done<span class="N"> “Kali I’m done! Where are you?”</span> . . . No response, so she shouted again.<span class="N"> “Kali I’m done! Where are you!”</span> . . . Again, No response. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She had gotten worried, was she gone too? Oh, this would be horrible. This encouraged nature to run as fast as she could in the north and east directions to find her. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ After a few minutes she saw a glimpse of her being dragged unconscious into the basement, she didn’t see who was dragging her though. She decided to watch from afar. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ After a few minutes she saw Death walk in, he was worried, and he had his sickle’s chained to his belt. He only has then when he is either going to fight or he just came from a fight. She thought it was the first option. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She had peeked from a cellar door just to see what was going to happen. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She saw a familiar figure in front of a cell door, he looked blood thirsty and deranged. She didn’t want to think who she thought it was. . . but all the evidence led back to Him. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Silence filled the room and blood was all over the floor, the two brothers were looking at each other blankly then progressively looking more enraged or psychotic. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Then in the blink of an eye Death had draw his weapons and swung at his brother leaving a trail of blood tainting his face. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Life wasn’t going to take kindly to this he had lunged forward at his brother slashing his face. They both began to draw even more blood until death gave out. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ His body became weak, and he had lost a lot of blood, life thought this was perfect for his little experiment. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ He had dragged both death and destruction to his layer where they would never return separate ever again. ♧</p>

        <h1 class="Line">♧</h1>

        <p class="Line">♧ Blood was drawn and strings were pulled, Nature was engulfed with rage and fear. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She didn’t want to believe the fact that the person she thought she could trust had done all these horrible things for what gain?!? ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She thought that she could at least try to confront him about this situation, even though she had sworn to herself that she would never even utter his name ever again . . . She had to do what must be done. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She went up to life’s layer hoping to talk some sense into him and get some answers. ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ When she walked in, she had seen someone lying on his work bench, sleeping. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She was confused, their clothes were torn, and their face was bloody, but they seemed to be fine. ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ She decided to get a little closer and investigate a little further. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She had stepped a little closer and found stitch marks covering their body head to toe. Nature had found it a bit odd. ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ Then she noticed a book open right next to this strange person, it was in life’s handwriting. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="L">“I have been running some experiments on the humans of earth and my results are unclear. I’m trying to make it so two souls can live inside of one vessel, conjoined twins if you will. My version is less of twins but more of one normal body, it’s hard to explain but everyone will see soon . . . very, soon and I know who my first test subjects are.” </span>Is what the book had read. ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ What Nature had found was truly gut wrenching, it was death and destruction sleeping on this table. She couldn’t help but cry. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ She heard footsteps approach her. She knew who it was . . . ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="L">“Why the long face Faun?”</span> Life had cackled. <span class="N">“You know why . . .”</span> <span class="L">“Do I?”</span> <span class="N">“Yes, you do, you monster!”</span> ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ The room was filled with her sobbing and his laughing... ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ He had dragged her by the wrist down to her room where she kept the plague that had developed into the awful virus its known to be today… ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="N">“No Stop! That thing is dangerous!” </span><span class="L">“Do I look like I care?”</span> ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ He was yelling at her to open it, but she refused<span class="N"> “No I’m not going to harm innocent people.”</span><span class="L"> “Who said you have a choice?"</span> <span class="N">“I did!”</span> She had kicked him in stomach and ran, she wasn’t good at a lot of things, but she was a pretty good runner, she was better than him that was for sure. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ <span class="L">“Get back here!”</span> He started to bolt after her, but she was too far away. ♧</p>
        
        <p class="Line">♧ This hunt lasted for days, he was getting mad, and she was getting tired. Eventually he caught her. She couldn’t fight back. ♧</p>

        <p class="Line">♧ Eventually it happened, she had to release the Virus . . . ♧</p>

        <p class="Line"><span class="DE">♧ She had no choice . . . ♧</span></p>
