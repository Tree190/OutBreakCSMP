    <h1 class="Title">The Virus Origin and info</h1>
    
    <p class="P-VO">The Mabuka Virus, a monster released onto the earth and wiped out nearly every human on its surface. This Virus was created by an unknown entity or force but is being controlled by a being who calls itself a god and the very being that created everything on this planet’s surface.</p>
    
    <p class="P-VO">Animals don’t seem to be affected by this virus, or at least not to a physical degree. Most animals seem to be put in a trance like state and only seem to be hostile when approached, no one knows why but a theory has been in a brew that the animals are just eyes for the culprit. </p>
    
    <p class="P-VO">Many humans that have been exposed to the Mabuka virus for the first time have a very high chance that they may already be infected but not realize it yet. In the earlier stages of mutation most people can’t even seem to be told apart from survivors, but other times you can’t even tell who the Infecti once were. </p>
    
    <p class="P-VO">The Virus seems to be almost acidic like to some certain people, other times it’s fattening or stretching the body’s length in certain areas. In some cases, people’s skin seems to be coming off in small, big, medium chunks leaving nothing but bones and blood, in other cases people’s skin seems to fatten and harden almost like a shield. One definite change that has been shown in all the cases, the Infecti’s brains and heart both stop pulsating and all the blood on the inside of the body has been slowly turning toxic.</p>
    
    <p class="P-VO">Cases when the Virus is acidic victims will experience sharp pains in their body and their skin will become less durable. Such as the elderly, their skin will appear leathery. The base skin pigment will also appear a slight green over some time due to the acidic like property of the virus. Eventually the victim’s skin as stated before will start to fall off, beginning in small chunks. Most victims will often dismiss the small chunks of flesh falling off as them ‘getting hurt easily,’ due to how the virus affects the victims state of mind which will cause them to just ‘ignore it’. Then the skin will come off in bigger chunks, but victims will ignore it due to the virus messing up their brain causing them to forget basic properties of what is minor and what is major in the terms of ‘harm’. Once the victim loses most of their body mass due to it falling off in chunks, they will die of blood loss and become whatever the virus has planned for them. Some Infecti that are a result of this process would be ‘Skeletons’ otherwise know as Rough Sketch’s in scientific Goddess or God origin and other ones are ‘Zombie’s’ or Walkers, ‘Husk’s’ or empty shell’s and so many more. </p>
    
    <p class="P-VO">Situations where the Virus causes the victims skin to harden are quite different though. Victims will experience extreme cases of calcification, a process where calcium builds up in body tissue which causes the tissue to harden. In these cases, it causes the victim to die in a more brutally internal way. Since the virus builds up a more immunity to death but a deterioration in regeneration of internal and external wounds it causes the victim to die longer than most others if they calcify. After most calcification processes the victim turns into an either bigger and bulkier or taller and lankier Infecti, examples being the ‘Ender’ or otherwise know in scientific Goddess or God origin the Eather more on that later, and an example of the bigger and bulkier Infecti would be a ‘Warden’ or otherwise known as The Overseer. An example of how they turn is either a ‘creeper,’ or a The Hunt, one last one I’m going to name which is part morph part calcify which is a ‘shulker’ or a Orbit Impact.</p>

    <p class="P-VO">Acidic Boil is when the subject’s skin will boil off their bones or erupt into flames. When it boils the victims skin off, the skin will be infected by the virus causing it to be a living blob of flesh. The flesh is completely burnt with a clear membrane created by the virus to cover it. Some cases the skin blobs will come together so they can make a bigger subject that would be more efficient at catching prey. When the subject erupts into flames, their skeleton will be the only thing left of them, although it’s completely charred it will come to life. Often the charred skeletons will be bigger in size compared to their original host, they’re usually armed with a sword as well.</p>

    <p class="P-VO">Morphing is when the body is essentially destroyed to make a new creature. Morphs don’t resemble humans in any way, they’re completely different. Some of them can form wings so they can take to the skies, others will change their entire body to better suit their environment. Morphed subjects attack survivors faster than other subjects of the virus. Cases where the subjects’ limbs are stretched or altered in any way can be considered morphing, although it will be mixed with whatever the class of the subject is. (Ex: Morphing + Liquefy)</p>

    <p class="P-VO">When the virus goes through a process where it Liquefies its subject it’ll create creatures that are related to water or beings that are jellylike. With cases where the virus makes subjects jelly like, if it so desired it could duplicate itself or divide into equal parts, so it doesn’t get harmed. Cases that the virus associates the subject related to water, the subject will appear mainly in bodies of water, but they can be seen walking around on land at night hours. Others related to water will stay in bodies of water either because they can’t breathe on the land due to them having gills or they simply don’t have a reason to.</p>
